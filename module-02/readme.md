# “THE RETURN”, TEXT ADVENTURE GAME

We'll be creating our own interactive text-adventure from scratch. This includes: setting up the Unity project and creating the user interface; creating world data structures; creating a game controller; processing user input; implementing a system of actions; adding the go action; adding items; adding item interactions; adding a conversation; finishing the game; and handing out assignments. We'll also be using the provided map which has several locations and items that the player can interact with. The player can type in simple commands in the form of verb-noun pairs, such as "go north," and the game will respond accordingly. The goal is to escape the island by answering questions from the ferryman, which the player learns while exploring the game.
