# "MERLIN'S DEMON WAR", CARD COMBAT GAME

We'll be creating an interactive card combat game from scratch. We'll design the game based on a specification document and use the Unity platform to create the game. We’ll need to set up the project, import graphics, create the cards, code the cards, create the player, deal the cards and the coroutines, add drag and drop, create attack spells, create defense spells, code the game, add sound effects, and complete our assignment. The player controls Merlin and they battle Mordred’s hordes of darkness using spells. The goal is to kill as many enemies as possible. We have a list of attack cards with mana costs, damage values, and additional notes.
