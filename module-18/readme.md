# Module 18: Game concept design

We will discuss concept design. This is the idea generation phase before we get expensive engineers and big teams involved in creating a game. It's important to have the right attitude and processes in place in order to have a successful project. This includes:

- Everything is interlinked - design, production, marketing, and pitching are not discrete processes, rather reiterative loops throughout the product life cycle
- There is no right way - different approaches can be used when creating a game, and what works for one person may not work for another
- Ignore your parents - they will love your ideas unconditionally, not judge the quality
- Love your friends - they will give you better advice, may even form a team with you, and can help build a platform for your game
- Don't go solo - don't develop your idea for too long without getting feedback from people
- You are the brand - when pitching to an investor or talking to someone about your game, it is important to look presentable and professional
- The quantum century - remain humble, take feedback onboard while still being determined and pushing forward to complete your game
- Have some beliefs - think of a mission statement or interests outside of gaming that you want to communicate to people in order to make your game more interesting and riveting
